<!--

This PR template is mandatory, please follow the guidance in the comments and
fill this in rather than removing it.

** An effective description is the minimum requirement for a PR to be approved. **

PRs to this repo are an audit trail of how we allow changes to our production
environment. Providing the context necessary to later readers and auditors is
important: please take a moment and add whatever information you can.

As a rule of thumb, the more unusual your request, the more information
you should provide.

-->

## Purpose

<!--

- Emphasize the WHY over the WHAT
- Remember your reviewer doesn't have your context, so explain the intent
- Remember that this may be read by an auditor (or even yourself in 6 months)

-->

## Context

<!--

For example:
    Where does this fit in? Part of work stream / epic / feature

    See:
    - JIRA-12345
    - [solution preview](confluence link)
    - #1234 (related PR)

** Be liberal with links. Reviewers and auditors need context for these changes. **

Useful links include (but are not limited to):

- JIRA references for the task being performed
- Backstage and Github references for the service
- Any previous PRs in this repository that are relevant (saves copying a lot of
  information if this is a follow-up)
- A failing build that this fixes
